This package provides a structured, context-first logging model for Laravel applications.

Instead of emitting many unstructured log lines during execution, the system accumulates contextual information throughout a request's lifecycle and emits **a single structured log event** at completion. The resulting log data is high-signal, query-friendly, and compatible with modern observability workflows.

**Inspired by** ["Logging sucks"](https://loggingsucks.com) - a comprehensive exploration of wide events and modern observability practices.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require michael4d45/context-logging
```

## Laravel Middleware Registration

This package requires two global HTTP middleware to function correctly:

* One to initialize request-level context
* One to emit a single structured log entry after the request completes

Laravel 12+ registers middleware via `bootstrap/app.php`.

### Registering Global Middleware

Open `bootstrap/app.php` and locate the `withMiddleware` section.

Append the package middleware to the global stack:

```php
use Illuminate\Foundation\Configuration\Middleware;
use Michael4d45\ContextLogging\Middleware\RequestContextMiddleware;
use Michael4d45\ContextLogging\Middleware\EmitContextMiddleware;

->withMiddleware(function (Middleware $middleware): void {
    $middleware->append(RequestContextMiddleware::class);
    $middleware->append(EmitContextMiddleware::class);
})
```

* `RequestContextMiddleware` runs early and seeds request metadata.
* `EmitContextMiddleware` implements both `handle` and `terminate` methods, ensuring it runs during request processing and emits the structured log entry after the response is sent.

Both middleware are appended to run after Laravel's core request processing.

### Ordering Considerations

Middleware execution order matters.

Recommended placement:

* `RequestContextMiddleware` **after** request normalization middleware (e.g. trimming, proxy handling)
* `EmitContextMiddleware` **at the end** of the global stack

Using `append()` achieves this safely.

If you need the request context earlier, you may use `prepend()` instead:

```php
$middleware->prepend(RequestContextMiddleware::class);
```

### Manually Managing the Global Middleware Stack (Optional)

If your application explicitly defines Laravel's global middleware stack using `use()`, include the package middleware in that list.

Example:

```php
use Illuminate\Foundation\Configuration\Middleware;
use Michael4d45\ContextLogging\Middleware\RequestContextMiddleware;
use Michael4d45\ContextLogging\Middleware\EmitContextMiddleware;

->withMiddleware(function (Middleware $middleware): void {
    $middleware->use([
        \Illuminate\Foundation\Http\Middleware\InvokeDeferredCallbacks::class,
        \Illuminate\Http\Middleware\TrustProxies::class,
        \Illuminate\Http\Middleware\HandleCors::class,
        \Illuminate\Foundation\Http\Middleware\PreventRequestsDuringMaintenance::class,
        \Illuminate\Http\Middleware\ValidatePostSize::class,
        \Illuminate\Foundation\Http\Middleware\TrimStrings::class,
        \Illuminate\Foundation\Http\Middleware\ConvertEmptyStringsToNull::class,

        // Contextual logging
        RequestContextMiddleware::class,
        EmitContextMiddleware::class,
    ]);
})
```

When using `use()`, Laravel **does not** automatically include defaults—you are responsible for the full stack. Both middleware should be included in the array.

### Notes

* Middleware registration is intentionally **not** automatic.
* This avoids surprising behavior and allows explicit control.
* No changes to route middleware or middleware groups are required.

### Summary

To enable contextual logging in Laravel:

1. Install the package via Composer
2. Register the two global middleware in `bootstrap/app.php`
3. Continue using `Log::info()`, `Log::error()`, etc. as usual

Once enabled, the package will emit **one structured log event per request** using Laravel's existing logging configuration.

## How It Works

### Traditional Logging

```
Application code → Log::info() → formatter → handler → output
```

### Contextual Logging

```
Application code → Log::info() → in-memory context only
Request termination → single wide event → Laravel logger → output
```

Log calls become **annotations** that are collected into comprehensive wide events.

### Bootstrap and early log calls

Logs that run **before** the request context is established are buffered and promoted into the next lifecycle that starts. For HTTP, that means any `Log::info()` (or other level) written during bootstrap, such as in `routes/channels.php`, in a service provider, or while `Broadcast::channel()` definitions are loaded, will be included in the eventual request-wide event instead of being discarded when `RequestContextMiddleware` initializes the store.

The same promotion behavior is used when console and queue lifecycles start, while long-lived lifecycle resets clear the store after emit so completed runs and jobs do not leak into the next one.

### Interrupted requests and console runs

If PHP exits before Laravel reaches its normal termination phase, the package now falls back to a shutdown handler. That means a request or console lifecycle can still emit its accumulated wide event when execution is interrupted by things like `dd()`, `exit`, or a fatal error.

Fatal shutdowns add a `PHP fatal error` event automatically. Non-fatal interruptions still emit a synthetic interruption event when nothing else was logged, so abrupt exits are visible instead of disappearing.

### Tinker behavior

`artisan tinker` is treated differently from normal console commands. Instead of buffering one giant context until you leave the shell, each evaluated statement gets its own lifecycle and emits immediately after execution. That keeps Tinker logging usable without waiting for shell exit.

## Philosophy: Wide Events Only

This package embraces **Wide Events** exclusively - no more scattered logs! Instead of emitting individual log entries throughout request processing, all logging calls are accumulated and emitted as a single comprehensive event at request completion.

**Why Wide Events?**
- **Complete context**: Every log call from the entire request in one place
- **Request metadata**: Method, path, duration, status, user info
- **Temporal ordering**: All events with precise timestamps
- **Query-friendly**: Single event per request for analysis
- **Clean logs**: No scattered entries to grep through

**The transformation:**
- ❌ **Before**: Dozens of individual log lines per request
- ✅ **After**: One structured event containing everything

Your logs stop lying to you. They start telling the whole truth.

## Usage

The package preserves the existing Laravel logging interface. No changes to your application code are required!

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log;

class OrderController extends Controller
{
    public function store(Request $request)
    {
        Log::info('Order placed', ['order_id' => 123]);

        // More application logic...
        Log::info('Payment processed', ['amount' => 99.99]);

        // Even error conditions
        try {
            $this->processOrder();
        } catch (\Exception $e) {
            Log::error('Order processing failed', [
                'error' => $e->getMessage(),
                'order_id' => 123
            ]);
        }

        return response()->json(['status' => 'success']);
    }
}
```

Instead of emitting 3 separate log entries, this produces a single wide event:

```json
{
  "message": "Request completed",
  "context": {
    "context": {
      "request_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
      "method": "POST",
      "path": "orders",
      "user_id": 42,
      "status": 200,
      "duration_ms": 83.4
    },
    "events": [
      {
        "level": "info",
        "message": "Order placed",
        "context": {
          "order_id": 123
        },
        "timestamp": 1767636443.123604
      },
      {
        "level": "info",
        "message": "Payment processed",
        "context": {
          "amount": 99.99
        },
        "timestamp": 1767636443.123730
      },
      {
        "level": "error",
        "message": "Order processing failed",
        "context": {
          "error": "Payment gateway timeout",
          "order_id": 123
        },
        "timestamp": 1767636443.296303
      }
    ]
  },
  "level": 200,
  "level_name": "INFO",
  "channel": "local",
  "datetime": "2026-01-05T18:07:23.389088+00:00",
  "extra": {}
}
```

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **Context Store**: Accumulates request-wide metadata and log events
- **Contextual Logger**: Mirrors Laravel's logging API but accumulates instead of emitting
- **Log Facade**: Drop-in replacement for Laravel's `Log` facade
- **Request Context Middleware**: Seeds baseline request metadata early in the pipeline
- **Emit Middleware**: Emits the single structured log entry after request completion

### Request Lifecycle

1. Request enters application
2. Request context middleware populates base metadata (request ID, method, path, etc.)
3. Application code calls `Log::*()` as usual - these become context annotations
4. Request completes
5. Terminating middleware emits one structured log entry via Laravel's logger
6. Laravel handles delivery via its configured logging stack

## Configuration

The package works out of the box with no configuration required. It provides wide events exclusively - no individual log pass-through.

You can optionally publish the configuration file for future customization:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Michael4d45\\ContextLogging\\ContextLoggingServiceProvider" --tag=config
```

This creates `config/context-logging.php` for future options like sampling rates, field filtering, and custom context enrichment.

### Outgoing HTTP Sub-Context Hooks

You can attach outbound HTTP request/response data as a sub-context layer without wrapping every `Http::` call.

The package provides:

- A global HTTP instrumentation service
- Hook registration methods you can call from your app
- Optional manual methods for per-call control

#### Global Setup

Outbound HTTP instrumentation is auto-registered when the package boots while `http.enabled=true`.

You can still register manually in `App\Providers\AppServiceProvider::boot()` if you want explicit control:

```php
use Michael4d45\ContextLogging\HttpClientInstrumentation;
use Michael4d45\ContextLogging\HttpContextHooks;

public function boot(): void
{
  // Optional explicit registration.
  app(HttpClientInstrumentation::class)->register();

  // Optional request hook.
  HttpContextHooks::beforeRequest(function (array $payload): array {
    $payload['request']['service'] = 'external-api';

    return $payload;
  });

  // Optional response hook.
  HttpContextHooks::afterResponse(function (array $payload): array {
    $payload['response']['classified_as'] = ($payload['response']['status'] ?? 0) >= 500
      ? 'server_error'
      : 'ok';

    return $payload;
  });
}
```

Once registered, all outbound `Http::get/post/...` calls are captured automatically.

You can control payload collection in `config/context-logging.php`:

```php
'http' => [
  'enabled' => true,
  'capture_headers' => false,
  'capture_body' => false,
  'redact_value' => '[redacted]',
  'redact_body_fields' => ['password', 'token', 'secret'],
  'redact_query_params' => ['token', 'access_token', 'api_key'],
],
```

Set `capture_body` to `true` when you need request/response body capture.
When body capture is enabled, configured `redact_body_fields` are masked recursively for JSON payloads.
Captured requests also include `path` and `query_params`, and configured `redact_query_params` are masked.

#### Optional Manual Control

`ContextStore` provides three methods:

- `beginHttpCall(array $request): string`
- `addHttpContext(string $id, array $extra): void`
- `completeHttpCall(string $id, array $response): void`

You can still use these for fine-grained control around specific calls:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Http;
use Michael4d45\ContextLogging\ContextStore;

public function syncOrders(ContextStore $contextStore): void
{
  $httpId = $contextStore->beginHttpCall([
    'method' => 'GET',
    'url' => 'https://api.example.com/orders',
  ]);

  try {
    $response = Http::get('https://api.example.com/orders');

    $contextStore->addHttpContext($httpId, [
      'service' => 'orders-api',
      'operation' => 'sync_orders',
    ]);

    $contextStore->completeHttpCall($httpId, [
      'status' => $response->status(),
      'ok' => $response->ok(),
    ]);
  } catch (\Throwable $exception) {
    $contextStore->completeHttpCall($httpId, [
      'status' => 0,
      'error' => $exception->getMessage(),
    ]);

    throw $exception;
  }
}
```

When outbound HTTP calls are tracked, they appear as interleaved events in the `events` array, sorted by timestamp alongside other log events.

Hooks are registered through `HttpContextHooks::beforeRequest()` and `HttpContextHooks::afterResponse()`.
If a hook throws an exception, processing continues and hook error details are attached to the tracked HTTP call.

## Compatibility

The package emits exactly one log entry using Laravel's standard `Log::info()` method, ensuring full compatibility with:

- JSON formatters
- stdout / stderr output
- File-based logging
- OpenTelemetry exporters
- Vendor-specific Monolog handlers
- All existing Laravel logging configuration

## Performance

- All operations are in-memory until request termination
- No I/O during request execution
- One log write per request
- Minimal object allocation
- No impact on response time

## Operational Characteristics

- Safe to enable incrementally
- Easy to disable via configuration or environment variable
- Does not interfere with existing logs outside HTTP requests
- Predictable log volume (1 log per HTTP request with events)
- Works with queues, jobs, and other Laravel features

## Error Handling

Exceptions and errors enrich the existing request context rather than being emitted separately. This guarantees correlation without relying on log aggregation heuristics.

## Future Extensions

The design supports future extensions without API breakage:

- Queue/job lifecycle equivalents
- Tail-based sampling
- Trace/span correlation
- Context namespacing
- Field-level redaction
